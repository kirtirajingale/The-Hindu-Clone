        Amid public unrest due to the unprecedented economic crisis followed by a political turmoil in the country, a senior Indian government official posted in Sri Lanka sustained grievous injuries in an unprovoked assault,the Indian High Commission said on Tuesday as it urged its nationals to remain aware of the latest developments in the island nation and plan their movements and activities accordingly.
        Acting President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the formerly Rajapaksa-aligned, and now independent Dullas Alahapperuma, and the leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake were on Tuesday nominated by parties in Parliament, a day ahead of the poll through a secret ballot.`

        In a robust but lopsided debate, Democrats argued intensely and often personally in favour of enshrining marriage equality in federal law, while Republicans steered clear of openly rejecting gay marriage. Instead leading Republicans portrayed the bill as unnecessary amid other issues facing the nation.
        Tuesday's election-year roll call, 267-157, was partly political strategy, forcing all House members, Republicans and Democrats, to go on the record. It also reflected the legislative branch pushing back against an aggressive court that has raised questions about revisiting other apparently settled U.S. laws.`

        Sources in the defence and security establishment said both sides have exchanged certain proposals regarding disengagement at Patrol Point (PP) 15, also known as the Hot Springs area.The delegations will convey the proposals to their respective higher authorities before engaging in further exchanges, sources said, adding that the issue of Demchok was also discussed. Both sides have agreed that there will be no further increase in the presence of troops deployed in Demchok.
        A joint statement issued Monday said that both sides had a “frank and in-depth exchange of views” and “agreed to stay in close contact and maintain dialogue through military and diplomatic channels and work out a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest”.`

        content: `Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal (ACM) V. R. Chaudhari Friday warned against the creation of an Air Defence (AD) Command, planned under the theaterisation process, without it having offensive capabilities. Chaudhuri said that division of offensive capabilities was  “ineffective in design or execution of the joint strategy”.
        The Air Chief Marshal made it clear that modern 4.5 and 5th generation aircraft have omni-role capability, and to restrict those aircraft to any one role would lead to their underutilisation.“Flexibility, one of the characteristics of air power, gives a planner the freedom to swing roles depending on the air situation, and this must be capitalised on,” he said, while addressing a seminar organised by the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS).

        His comments came at a time when the theaterisation process envisions an Air Defence Command under the Indian Air Force and aviation assets being split into other theatres.
        
        The IAF, which has been supporting jointness, is of the view that there should only be once Command — India Command — with all the three Services working in synergy.`

WASP-96 b is one of more than 5,000 confirmed exoplanets in the Milky Way.Located roughly 1,150 light-years away in the southern-sky constellation Phoenix, it represents a type of gas giant that has no direct analogue in our solar system, it said in a statement.
        With a mass less than half that of Jupiter and a diameter 1.2 times greater, WASP-96 b is much puffier than any planet orbiting our Sun. With a temperature greater than 538 degrees Celsius, it is significantly hotter.
        WASP-96 b orbits extremely close to its Sun-like star, just one-ninth of the distance between Mercury and the Sun, completing one circuit every three-and-a-half Earth-days, according to NASA.
        The combination of large size, short orbital period, puffy atmosphere, and lack of contaminating light from objects nearby in the sky makes WASP-96 b an ideal target for atmospheric observations.`

        Meraxes gigas had tiny forelimbs just like Tyrannosaurus rex.
        Paleontologists have announced the discovery of new giant dinosaur species that had massive head and tiny forelimbs, just like Tyrannosaurus rex. The findings about the discovery of the new species Meraxes gigas have been published in the journal Current Biology. In the piece, the researchers said that both the apex predators evolved their proportionately tiny arms independently. They further said that these forelimbs were not a result of some evolutionary accident but gave both T-rex and Meraxes gigas certain survival advantages.
        The new dinosaur species has been named after a fictional dragon in the Game of Thrones book series. It was dug up over the course of four years during field expeditions in the northern Patagonia region of Argentina, starting with the skull which was found in 2012.The skull of the dinosaur is just over four feet long, while the entire animal would have been some 36 feet long, according to researchers. They calculated its weight to be around four metric tons.
        Its arms were two feet long, said the paleontologists, by examining the fossil which they said were "well preserved".
        T-rexes went extinct 20 million years before Meraxes gigas arose, and the two species were far apart on the evolutionary tree.
        The Meraxes belong to tyrannosaurids and carcharodontosaurids group of dinosaurs.
        They roamed the Earth between 90 to 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous period when the region had more forests and much closer to the sea, according to senior author Peter Makovicky from the University of Minnesota.
        The average age of these dinosaurs was 40 and its skull was replete with crests, furrows, bumps and small hornlets`

The hole is located in the lower stratosphere and is seven times bigger than the one over Antarctica, according to a paper published in AIP Advances.
        The newly-discovered all-season hole sits over the tropics and has been there for more than 30 years, said Qing-Bin Lu, a scientist from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, who made the discovery.The ozone hole is not technically a "hole" where no ozone is present, but is actually a region of exceptionally depleted levels of the gas, according to American space agency NASA.

        Environmentalists describe the ozone hole as an area where the loss of the gas is 25 per cent more than the undisturbed atmosphere.
        NASA says that the depletion of the ozone gas is caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These chemicals escape into the atmosphere from refrigeration and propellant devices and other such things. In the lower atmosphere, they are so stable that they persist for years, even decades, according to NASA website.

These CFCs release chlorine after coming into contact with the ultraviolet rays of the Sun, which ultimately destroy ozone.`

        The research, recently published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, was conducted using chicken, beef, pork, and salmon, and surrogate viruses with spikes similar to those on SARS-CoV-2.
        The researchers stored the meat and fish products at both refrigeration (4 degrees Celsius) and freezer temperatures (minus 20 degrees C).
        "Although you might not store meat in the fridge for 30 days, you might store it in the freezer for that long," said study first author Emily S. Bailey, an assistant professor at Campbell University in the US.
        "We even found that the viruses could be cultured after (being frozen for) that length of time," Bailey said in a statement.
        The researchers undertook the study after learning that COVID-19 outbreaks were occurring in Southeast Asia prior community transmission.
        Reports from those communities "suggested that packaged meat products, produced in areas where SARS-CoV-2 was circulating, could have been the source of the virus," said Bailey.
        "Our goal was to investigate whether or not similar viruses could survive in this environment," she said.`

        content: `Netflix is experimenting with a new method of payment from freeloaders who steal passwords. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company is introducing a feature that allows customers to legitimately enable access from a second home for an additional monthly fee in five Latin American nations. The "add a home" feature will be available on Netflix in Argentina, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras starting the following month.
        Anyone in each additional home will then be able to stream Netflix on any device at a price that is less expensive than full standalone membership, according to the report.
        This comes after the streaming service in March launched a feature called "add extra member" in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru that allows users to pay a monthly fee to grant access to Netflix to people outside of their households.According to Netflix, users share their login information with more than 100 million non-paying households worldwide, including more than 30 million in the United States and Canada, in violation of the company's terms of service.
        As per Chengyi Long, Netflix's director of product innovation, "widespread account sharing between households undermines our long-term ability to invest in and improve our service".
        It will cost Netflix subscribers in the five new markets ARS 219 (roughly Rs. 140) per home per month in Argentina and $2.99 (roughly Rs. 240) per home per month in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to purchase an additional "home" for streaming access.Customers with the Basic plan may add one additional home; those with the Standard plan may buy up to two additional homes, and subscribers to the Premium tier may buy up to three additional homes.
        Customers can add up to two Extra Member accounts for an additional $2-$3 (roughly Rs. 160 – Rs. 240) per month each in Netflix's tests in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru.
        Notably, rather than the actual walls of a home, Netflix's password-sharing policies apply to everyone in a customer's household. As an illustration, the company said paying customers can access Netflix while travelling.`

Joe Manchin of West Virginia has quashed the idea of imposing higher taxes on the rich and corporations as part of a separate Democratic-only effort. Three weeks ago, the computer chips bill looked like it could be in trouble despite having bipartisan support. That's when Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said there would be no such bill as long as Democrats pursued what he called a “partisan reconciliation bill." But Manchin's decision to dramatically narrow the Democratic effort and axe the tax hikes appears to have opened the window for Republican cooperation on semiconductors.
        Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who endorsed McConnell's approach, said on the Senate floor Monday that Manchin's announcement on taxes means “we're in a posture where we can go forward with the chips funding and other related provisions.”
        “I hope we will be able to take action on that in the coming days," Cornyn said.The Biden administration is pressing Congress to move quickly on the semiconductor legislation before they leave for their month-long August recess. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that chipmakers are making decisions now about where they need to locate plants to keep up with global demand, and that foreign competitors are courting those companies with financial aid`

        content: `Concerned over makers of cars, mobiles and other consumer goods monopolising repair and spare parts market, the government plans to make it mandatory for them to share with customers product details necessary for repair by self or third parties.
        The Department of Consumer Affairs said in a statement on Thursday that it has set up a committee — chaired by Nidhi Khare, Additional Secretary — to develop comprehensive framework on Right to Repair.
        Generally, manufacturers retain proprietary control over spare parts, including on their design, and the government feels that this kind of monopoly on repair processes infringes the customer's "right to choose".
        Besides, warranty cards of several products mention that getting them repaired from an outfit not recognised by the makers would lead to customers losing their warranty benefit.
        The rationale behind the Right to Repair is that when customers buy a product, it is inherent that they must own it completely "for which the consumers should be able to repair and modify the product with ease and at reasonable cost, without being captive to the whims of manufacturers for repairs," according to the statement.
        The objective of the proposed framework will be to empower consumers, harmonise trade between the original equipment manufacturers and the third-party buyers and sellers, and reduction in e-waste.
        On July 13, the committee held its first meeting where key sectors for Right to Repair were identified. Sectors, including farming equipment, mobile phones/ tablets, consumer durables and automobiles/automobile equipment were listed out.
